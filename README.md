# FPGA-Cat-Box-Signature-Files
This is a repository for Signature Analysis Files that are used with the FPGA Cat Box tool.

Eveyone is welcome to contribute and I have written software that interfaces with this Repository and allows you to edit the Signature Files.

The structure should be:

'''
Manufacturer 
     |____ Game Title
               |_____ Signature Files
'''               
               
For convenience sake, should use the common name of the manufacturer.  For example, instead of say Atari Games, just use Atari.

If there are multiple versions of a board, I would say create multiple Game Title directories.

For example:
  Atari
    |__ Dig Dug Board A
    |__ Dig Dug Board B
    
If the board has multiple manufacturers such as Dig Dug has an Atari Version and Namco version, please create a Namco Manufacturer directory and put the signatures under there.

For example:
  Atari
    |__ Dig Dug Board A
    |__ Dig Dug Board B
  Namco
    |__ Dig Dug
